Repository created to make the first main project of The Odin Project

Although I already know more than the basic of html, I don't have prove
of my capabilities doing even the basic, and try to sometimes polish the fundamentals is always a good idea, I am learning 1 or 2 little things while
revisiting html basics. Also, it is my first time using Git and GitHub seriously,
trying to do atomic, concise and overall good commits.

So this project will prove and test my basic understanding of html coding and git usage.
