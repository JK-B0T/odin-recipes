Repository created to make the first main project of The Odin Project

Although I already know more than the basics of html, I don't have any proof
of my capabilities doing even the basics, and trying to sometimes polish the fundamentals is always a good idea as I am learning 1 or 2 little things while
revisiting html basics. Also, it is my first time using Git and GitHub seriously,
trying to do atomic, concise and overall good commits.

So this project will prove and test my basic understanding of html coding and Git/GitHub usage.
